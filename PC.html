                <div id="prosexamples">
                    <div id="example">1. Manufacturing Options</div>
                    <div id="explain">-3D Printing allows the use of printing maufactured products, including customizable products</div>
                    <div id="example">2. Rapid Prototyping</div>
                    <div id="explain">-Products can go from being just a design to becoming an actual prototype</div>
                    <div id="example">3. Manufacturing Speed</div>
                    <div id="explain">-Just like previous advantages, manufacturing is just as easy for a large amount of final products</div>
                    <div id="example">4. Reduced Cost</div>
                    <div id="explain">-3D printing has become cheaper than labor in 3rd world countries. Costs are still decreasing with the potential of 3D printed homes in the near future</div>
                    <div id="example">5. Warehousing</div>
                    <div id="explain">3D printing allows only the items that are sold to be built and shipped leaving more space in warehouses. While manufturing doesnt have to be stocked constantly to make sure that everyone has the item that they need.</div>
                    <div id="example">6. More Jobs</div>
